In this tutorial we will build Peeved Penguins -- a clone of the popular mobile game [Angry Birds](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/angry-birds/id343200656?mt=8). We will use Apple's new Swift programming language together with SpriteBuilder and Cocos2D.

<!-- If you aren't familiar with SpriteBuilder you should read our [SpriteBuilder beginner tutorial](https://www.makeschool.com/tutorials/getting-started-with-spritebuilder-and-swift/installing-spritebuilder) first since this tutorial assumes that you are familiar with basic SpriteBuilder tasks. Make sure you have both SpriteBuilder and Xcode installed! -->

#What you will learn

Throughout this tutorial you will learn many concepts including how to:

- Switch scenes from main menu to gameplay
- Use the Cocos2D physics engine
- Load levels from CCB files
- Use the timeline for sprite frame and key frame animations
- Make a game that is compatible with both iPhone and iPad

#The finished product

We'll be making a basic clone of Angry Birds with a catapult launcher and seal enemies. The final game will look like this:
